# Hi, I’m Parth 👋

I’m a backend engineer focused on building reliable, scalable systems.

I work primarily with Go, databases, caching layers, and API-heavy architectures.
Most of my work involves real-world constraints like performance, correctness, and scale.

## Current Focus

- Designing backend services and APIs
- Learning more about distributed systems and internals
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable systems

You can learn more about me on the [About](/about/) page.
